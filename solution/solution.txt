The project objective is to deploy a Corporate Training Portal 
for employees.

We will use the popular LMS - Moodle, which is also most widely
used LMS in the world. 

The Deployment Manager service is used for a faster provisioning
and for filestorage, the Cloud Storage service was defined to 
provide high availability.
